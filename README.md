# Library

Library project for The Odin Project
The code ended up becoming really messy, but I am still glad with the result.
It was the first time I used a remote database in a project, and it was a challenge to deal with the asynchronous behaviour resulted from using firebase.
I hope I can write cleaner and more organized code on future projects.
